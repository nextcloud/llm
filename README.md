# A large language model in Nextcloud

This app ships a TextProcessing provider using a Large Language Model that runs locally on CPU

The models run completely on your machine. No private data leaves your servers.

Models:

* Llama 2 by Meta
  * Languages: English
  * [LLAMA 2 Community License](https://download.nextcloud.com/server/apps/llm/llama-2-7b-chat-ggml/LICENSE)
* GPT4All Falcon by Nomic AI
  * Languages: English
  * [Apache License 2.0](https://download.nextcloud.com/server/apps/llm/LICENSE)
* Leo HessianAI by LAION LeoLM
  * Languages: English/German
  * [LLAMA 2 Community License](https://download.nextcloud.com/server/apps/llm/leo-hessianai-13B-chat-bilingual-GGUF/LICENSE)

Requirements:

* x86 CPU
* GNU lib C (musl is not supported)
* Python 3.10+ (including python-venv)

#### Nextcloud All-in-One:
With Nextcloud AIO, this app is not going to work because AIO uses musl. However you can use [this community container](https://github.com/nextcloud/all-in-one/tree/main/community-containers/local-ai) as replacement for this app.
