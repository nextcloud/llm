The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) has warned that the planet is likely to breach a key climate threshold for the first time within the next five years due to a combination of heat-trapping pollution and a looming El Nino.

Global temperatures have soared in recent years as the world continues to burn planet-warming fossil fuels like coal, oil and gas. And that trend shows no sign of slowing.

Breaching the 1.5-degree threshold may only be temporary, but it would be the clearest signal yet of how quickly climate change is accelerating.

Ocean temperatures are off the charts right now, and scientists are alarmed.

Countries pledged in the Paris Climate Agreement to limit global warming to well below 2 degrees Celsius compared to pre-industrial temperatures. Scientists consider 1.5 degrees of warming as a key tipping point, beyond which the chances of extreme flooding, drought, wildfires and food shortages could increase dramatically.
